# Data Science Professional Certificate
## Capstone Project
This repository holds progress and completion files for the Capstone project,
  the final course and activity for my IBM Data Scientist Professional Certificate.

## Scenario

- Falcon 9 rocket launches (with SpaceX) cost around US$62M
- Other vendors charge US$165M
- The main difference is that SpaceX endeavours to recover and reuse the first-stage rockets
- Most of the work of a launch is done in the first stage
    - Rockets involved in later stages are more for manouvering in space
- "If we can determine if the first stage will land (i.e. for recovery) we can determine the cost of a launch"
- Not all recovery is successful:
    - Sometimes the stage doesn't land
    - Sometimes it crashes upon landing
    - Other times SpaceX will sacrifice the first stage recovery due to mission parameters such as payload, orbit and customer

## Outline of the task to be completed, as the final project

- We take the role of a data scientist, employed at SpaceY by billionaire Allon Mask
- SpaceY wants to compete with SpaceX
- The job is to determine the price of each launch
- We are to determine if SpaceY will reuse the first stage, based on data science and prediction
